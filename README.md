# Contributing/committing
### **PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH** (to avoid any oopie doopies)
Don't commit a file that you didn't do anything to.

`.repil` and any IDE config files should **NOT** be pushed!

### Committing sequence
`$ git add foo` (replace `foo` with whatever file you want to commit) 

`$ git pull` (or your IDE's equivalent)

`$ git commit && git push` (or your IDE's equivalent)
